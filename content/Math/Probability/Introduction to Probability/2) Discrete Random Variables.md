#### 2.1 Basic Concepts

- **Random Variable (RV)**: A function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of an experiment.
  - A random variable is called **discrete** if it can take a finite or countably infinite number of values.
  - Example: The number of heads in a sequence of coin tosses.

#### 2.2 Probability Mass Function (PMF)

- The **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** of a discrete random variable $X$ is denoted by $p_X(x)$ and represents the probability that $X = x$:
  $$
  p_X(x) = P(X = x)
  $$
  - For all $x$:
    $$
    \sum_x p_X(x) = 1
    $$
- Example: If $X$ represents the number of heads in two independent tosses of a fair coin, the PMF of $X$ is:
  $$
  p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
  \frac{1}{4} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ or } x = 2 \\
  \frac{1}{2} & \text{if } x = 1 \\
  0 & \text{otherwise} 
  \end{cases}
  $$

#### 2.3 Functions of Random Variables

- A function $g(X)$ of a random variable $X$ is itself a random variable.
- The PMF of $g(X)$ can be computed from the PMF of $X$.

#### 2.4 Expectation, Mean, and Variance

- **Expectation** or **Mean**: The expected value of a discrete random variable $X$ is:
  $$
  E[X] = \sum_x x p_X(x)
  $$
- **Moment** (n-th):
$$E[X^n]$$
- **Variance**: The variance of $X$ measures the spread of its values:
$$Var(X)=E[(X-E[X])^2]$$
$$=E[X^2 -2E[X]X + (E[X])^2]$$
$$= E[X^2] - 2E[X]E[X] + (E[X])^2$$
$$
  \text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
  $$
- **Standard Deviation**: measures spread (like variance) but same units as $X$
$$\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{var(X)}$$
##### Expected Value rule for Functions of Random Variables
$$E[g(X)]=\sum_x g(x)p_X(x)$$
#### 2.5 Joint PMFs of Multiple Random Variables

- **Joint PMF**: For two random variables $X$ and $Y$, the joint PMF is $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$, which gives the probability of the event $X = x$ and $Y = y$:
  $$
  p_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X = x, Y = y)
  $$
  - The **marginal PMF** of $X$ is obtained by summing over all possible values of $Y$:
  $$
  p_X(x) = \sum_y p_{X,Y}(x,y)
  $$

#### 2.6 Conditioning

- **Conditional PMF**: The conditional PMF of $X$ given $Y = y$ is:
  $$
  p_{X|Y}(x|y) = \frac{p_{X,Y}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}, \quad \text{if } p_Y(y) > 0
  $$
 ![[Pasted image 20250311153955.png]]
  - The **Total Expectation Theorem** relates the expectation of $X$ to the conditional expectations:
  $$
  E[X] = \sum_y p_Y(y) E[X|Y = y]
  $$

#### 2.7 Independence

- Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if:
  $$
  p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x) p_Y(y) \quad \text{for all } x, y
  $$

#### Special Discrete Random Variables

1. **Bernoulli Random Variable**:
   - A Bernoulli random variable takes two values, typically 0 and 1.
   - PMF:
     $$
     p_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
     p & \text{if } x = 1 \\
     1 - p & \text{if } x = 0 
     \end{cases}
     $$
   - Expectation: $E[X] = p$, Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = p(1 - p)$

2. **Binomial Random Variable**:
   - A sum of independent Bernoulli trials.
   - PMF:
     $$
     p_X(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-k}, \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n
     $$
   - Expectation: $E[X] = np$, Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = np(1 - p)$
   - *See [[1) Sample space & probability#1.6 Independence]] for intuition*

3. **Geometric Random Variable**:
   - Counts the number of trials until the first success.
   - PMF:
     $$
     p_X(k) = (1 - p)^{k-1} p, \quad k = 1, 2, \dots
     $$
   - Expectation: $E[X] = \frac{1}{p}$, Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{1 - p}{p^2}$

4. **Poisson Random Variable**:
   - Approximation of Binomial where $p$ is small and $n$ is large.
   - PMF:
     $$
     p_X(k) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda ^ k}{k!}, \quad k = 1, 2, \dots
     $$
   - Expectation: $E[X] = \lambda$, $Var(X) = \lambda$
